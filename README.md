# 3D Solar System Simulation

A fully interactive 3D simulation of our solar system built with Three.js. This project visualizes all eight planets orbiting the Sun with realistic physics, lighting, and user controls.

## Features

- **Complete Solar System**: All eight planets (Mercury to Neptune) orbiting the Sun
- **Realistic Visualization**: Proper relative sizes, colors, and orbital paths
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust orbital speeds of individual planets in real-time
- **Camera Controls**: Orbit, pan, and zoom to explore the solar system from any angle
- **Special Details**: Saturn with rings, background stars, planet tooltips
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes
- **Pause/Resume**: Control the animation flow

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library for rendering the solar system
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Animation, interactivity, and physics calculations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone //(https://meenu-narwal.github.io/3D-simulation-of-the-solar-system/)

## Usage

- **Adjust Planet Speeds**: Use the sliders in the control panel to change the orbital speed of each planet
- **Explore the View**: Click and drag to rotate the view, scroll to zoom in/out
- **Identify Planets**: Hover over planets to see their names
- **Pause/Resume**: Click the Pause button to stop the animation, Resume to continue
- **Toggle Theme**: Switch between dark and light modes using the theme toggle button
- **Collapse Controls**: Click the toggle button to hide/show the control panel
